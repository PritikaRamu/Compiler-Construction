% Expected output in three independent runs of code.asm 
% run 1- for c2 = 4 and c3bd is read iteratively as blank separated data as 23 7 9 10, then the output is 49
% run 2- for c2 = 7 and c3bd is read iteratively as blank separated data as 23 -19 100 -21 7 9 10, then the output is 109
% run 3- for c2 = 8 and c3bd is read iteratively as blank separated data as -187 20 -11 -78 23 7 9 10, then the output is -207
