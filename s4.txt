%Test Case 4: Semantic analysis - while loop variables, function overloading and recursion
%Details: 
%        (a) Simple arithmetic expressions involvoing record data types, their aliases and primitive data types are used in this test case
%        (b) Multiple modules
%	 (c) Handles semantic checks relating to number and type of parameters in function modules and 
%            while loop variable (any one should be assigned a value through assignment, function call or read statements), function overloading and recorsion are 
%            not allowed
%        (d) The variables participating in the expression need not be initialized any values. Only test cases for code generation will have all values initialized or read appropriately.
% The errors are reported by me in the test cases right in front of the corresponding line in comment form. 
% It is essential for you to report errors with LINE NUMBERS correctly.	 

%The following source code is expected to be syntactically correct as per the modified grammar.
%If any line has syntax error, please inform me as that error needs to be fixed in this test case.
