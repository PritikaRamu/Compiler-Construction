# Compiler-Construction
This project was done as part of the course CS F363 (Compiler Construction) in the Second Semester of AY 21-22 under the guidance of  Prof. Vandana Agarwal, BITS Pilani.

## Brief Description
The Compiler translates a Strongly typed language (Primitive and Complex data types) into equivalent machine code. The compiler was written entirely in the C language. The code was written in 2 stages and includes the following modules:
- Lexical Analyzer
- Syntax Analyzer
- Abstract Syntax Tree, Symbol Table
- Type Checker (Syntax analysis)
- Semantic Analyzer
- Code Generator

## Installation and Use
Simply run the .exe file using the command <em>./stage2exe testcase.txt</em> (ensure the test cases exist in the same directory). Alternatively, you may use the makefile. Once executed, select one of the 10 options to demonstrate the compiler's capabilities.
