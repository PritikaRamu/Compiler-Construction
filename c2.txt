%Test case 2- Simple expressions involving real data type
_main
	type real :b3;
	type real : b2;
	type real : c2;
	type real : d2;
	read(b2);
	c2<--- 35.45;
	read(d2);

	b3 <--- b2 + c2 + d2;
	write(b3);
	return;
end

% Expected output in three independent runs of code.asm 
% run 1- for b2 = 17.43 and d2 = 26.33, the output is 79.21
% run 2- for b2 = -265.50 and d2 = 458.22, the output is 228.17
% run 3- for b2 = -100.89 and d2 = -126.98, the output is -192.42
% Note that the machine on which the code is run supports the real values to be negative 
% and these values can participate in any computation as real number
% NOTE: If you implemened the associativity from right  to left, mention that while printing the output
