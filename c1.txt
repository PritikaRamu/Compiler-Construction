%Test case 1- Simple expressions involving integer data type
_main
	type int :b3;
	type int : b2;
	type int : c2;
	type int : d2;
	read(b2);
	c2<--- 35;
	read(d2);

	b3 <--- b2 + c2 + d2;
	write(b3);
	return;
end

% Expected output in three independent runs of code.asm 
% run 1- for b2 = 17 and d2 = 26, the output is 78
% run 2- for b2 = -265 and d2 = 458, the output is 228
% run 3- for b2 = -100 and d2 = -126, the output is -191
% Note that the machine on which the code is run supports the integer values to be negative 
% and these values can participate in any computation as integer
% NOTE: If you implemened the associativity from right  to left, mention that while printing the output
