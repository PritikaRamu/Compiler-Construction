%Test Case 1: Type checking 
%Details: 
%        (a) Simple arithmetic expressions involvoing primitive data types are used in this test case
%        (b) Only main module is used and no other function is used in this test case
%	 (c) All variables are declared once only before their use
%        (d) The variables participating in the expression need not be initialized any values. Only test cases for code generation will have all values initialized or read appropriately.
% The errors are reported by me in the test cases right in front of the corresponding line in comment form. 
% It is essential for you to report errors with LINE NUMBERS correctly.	 

%The following source code is expected to be syntactically correct as per the modified grammar.
%If any line has syntax error, please inform me as that error needs to be fixed in this test case.
